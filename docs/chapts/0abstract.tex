Population aging has raised concerns about its impact on the labor supply. However, quantifying these effects often focuses only on the increase in the elderly population, at the expense of the working age groups. This article estimates the aggregate labor supply in Spain and examines the extent to which population aging, immigration, and individual behaviors have contributed to its growth between 2006 and 2023.
